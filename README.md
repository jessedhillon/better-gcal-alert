# Goddamn Google Calendar and its focus-stealing behavior

## Seriously, fuck this shit.

When your calendar emits an `alert()`, this extension will play a nice sound and show a
*non-focus stealing* modal. The modals get stacked up and you can dismiss them at once or
individually. The sound will play at most once per five minutes (so you won't hear a bunch
of chimes if multiple events occur at the same time).
